# Anti.Analysis

This repository contains additional material for the Paper *Analysis, Anti-Analysis, Anti-Anti-Analysis: An Overview of the Evasive Malware Scenario*.

## Authors

This work was developed by Marcus Botacin and Vitor Falcão da Rocha, under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Paulo Lício de Geus](http://www.lasca.ic.unicamp.br/paulo/) and [Prof. Dr. André Ricardo Abed Grégio](https://sites.google.com/site/argregio/).

## Goals

* Provide implementations for known anti-analysis tricks.
* Evaluate these detectors in distinct usage scenarios.
* Analyze distinct datasets regarding their anti-analysis tricks.

## Whitepaper

The *Whitepaper* directory contains additional material for the published paper, including additional discussion, graphs, and so on.

## Tricks

The *Tricks* directory contains some assembly implementations of the mentioned tricks. These can be used for validating our detectors.

## Detectors

The *Detectors* directory contains python implementation for the tricks detectors.

## Data and Results

The *Data* directory describes names, hashes, and tricks detected for each binary/used dataset.

## Misc

The *Misc* directory contains some code and other stuff used for additional tests.

## Publication

The paper *Analysis, Anti-Analysis, Anti-Anti-Analysis: An Overview of the Evasive Malware Scenario* will appear in *Proceedings of [SBSEG 2017](https://sbseg2017.redes.unb.br/)*.
