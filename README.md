# Anti.Analysis

This repository contains additional material for the Paper *Malware: Analysis, Anti-Analysis, and Anti-Anti-Analysis*.

## Authors

This work was developed by Marcus Botacin and Vitor Falcão da Rocha, under supervision of Prof. Dr. Paulo Lício de Geus and Prof. Dr. André Ricardo Abed Grégio.

## Goals

* Provide Implementations for known anti-analysis tricks
* Evaluate these detector in distinct usage scenarios
* Analyze distinct datasets regarding their anti-analysis tricks

## Whitepaper

The *Whitepaper* directory contains additional material for the published paper, including additional discussion, graphs, and so on.

## Tricks

The *Tricks* directory contains some assembly implementations of the mentioned tricks. These can be used for validating our detectors.

## Detectors

The *Detectors* directory contains python implementation for the tricks detectors.

## Data and Results

The *Data* directory describes names, hashes, and tricks detected for each binary/used dataset.
